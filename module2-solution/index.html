          Goku is a Saiyan originally sent to destroy Earth as an infant.
          However, a head injury at an early age alters his memory, ridding
          him of his initial destructive nature and allowing him to grow up
          to become one of Earth's greatest defenders. He constantly strives
          and trains to be the greatest warrior possible, which has kept the
          Earth and the universe safe from destruction many times.

        <article>
          Regal, egotistical, and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless,
          cold-blooded warrior and outright killer, but later abandons his
          role in the Frieza Force, instead opting to remain and live on Earth.
          His character evolves from villain, to anti-hero, then to hero
          through the course of the series, repeatedly fighting alongside the
          universe's most powerful warriors in order to protect his new home
          and surpass Goku in power.

          The twin brother of Android 18 and Dr. Gero's seventeenth android
          creation, designed to serve Gero's vendetta against Goku. Despite
          his interests not initially deviating from this expectation, Android
          17 takes it upon himself to kill Dr. Gero, who is uncooperative with
          Android 18's curiosity in activating Android 16 and deemed inferior
          by 17. He is asked by Goku to join Team Universe 7 in the Tournament
          of Power and due to Goku and Frieza's sacrifice to take out Jiren,
          he is left as the sole fighter remaining by the end of the tournament
          and the one who makes the wish on the Super Dragon Balls.
